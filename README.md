# ZAHEER ABZAL
I am a technologist, software engineer, artist, content creator; an eternal student. Check out my thoughts on technology and the business of sofware on my [blog](medium.com/@zaheerabzal). Also follow me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/realzaheerabzal) and [Pintrest](http://pinterest.com/zaheerabzal) to chat and see what else I am up to.

### My Ninja Way
- My development philosophy is around lean [#softwareproductdevelopment](www.twitter.com/hashtag/softwareproductdevelopment?src=hashtag_click) which results in agility.
- I default to open technology and tools as I believe that open standards underpins a composable software future.

### Skills
- Software Engineering: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Containers (Podman, Buildah, Docker)
- Data Science/Data Engineering: Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow
- Digital Art: Krita, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer
