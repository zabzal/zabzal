# ZAHEER ABZAL
I am a technologist, software engineer, artist; eternal student. Check out my thoughts on technology and the business of software at [Business & Code](medium.com/@zaheerabzal). Also follow me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/realzaheerabzal) and [Pintrest](http://pinterest.com/zaheerabzal) to chat and see what else I am up to.

### My Ninja Way
- I practice lean software product development to nimbly create product customers love.
- I default to open technology and tools as I believe that open standards underpins a composable software future.
