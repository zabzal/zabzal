### ZAHEER ABZAL
I am a technologist, software engineer, artist, content creator; an eternal student. Check out my thoughts on technology and the business of sofware on my [blog](medium.com/@zaheerabzal). Also follow me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/realzaheerabzal) and [Pintrest](http://pinterest.com/zaheerabzal) to chat and see what else I am up to.

In my career I have taken on a wide range of roles that run the spectrum of software and business: Software Engineer, Web Designer, Software Architect, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Analytics Engineer, Product Manager, Technical Lead, People Leader, Lean/Agile Coach, Customer Liason etc. Being a life long learner, I have picked up a breadth of knowledge and skills along the way.
